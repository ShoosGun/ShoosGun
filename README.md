Hello! I am a C#, and sometimes C/C++, programmer. I have experience modding Unity games from Unity 4.1 to Unity 2022, and have a bigger knowledge of using reflection to edit IL code with [Harmony](https://harmony.pardeike.net/) at runtime and using the built-in sockets for low-level networking. I like to build systems/frameworks for modding from time to time, which is why one of favorite projects, and perhaps the biggest, that I have made is [SlateShipyard](https://github.com/ShoosGun/SlateShipyard), a framework for adding custom ships for the game Outer Wilds.
