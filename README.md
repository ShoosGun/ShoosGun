Hello! I am an "all C" programmer (C/C++/C#). I have experience modding Unity games from Unity 4.1 to Unity 2022, and have a bigger knowledge of using reflection to edit IL code with [Harmony](https://harmony.pardeike.net/) at runtime and using the built-in sockets for low-level networking. I like to build systems/frameworks for modding from time to time, like [SlateShipyard](https://github.com/ShoosGun/SlateShipyard), or design strange hardware architectures, like in [tt-bf-processor](https://github.com/loco-choco/tt-bf-processor).

These days I have been "nixifying" a lot of stuff, and I am trying to use nix as a "Yosys project builder" for different FPGAs ([nixyosys](https://github.com/loco-choco/nixyosys)).
